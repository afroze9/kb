# Concepts to remember

* Dockerfiles should have a step that restores the csproj first. Then copies the remaining files. Configuration should ideally be copied after build. Example is in dotnet-project-management repo
* For minimal apis, there are a few ways to make "testable" endpoints:
  * Use the fastapi (needs validation) package
  * Use static functions with IEndpointBuilder
* In .NET 6 and above, its good to have extension methods/classes that do the following to ensure controllable build order:
  * Configure logging
  * Configure configuration
  * Configure services
